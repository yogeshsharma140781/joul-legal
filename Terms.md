You must be at least 16 years old (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) to use Joul. By using the app, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.

## 2. Description of Service

Joul is a nutrition and meal‑tracking app that helps you log meals, view macro and micronutrient information, and receive AI‑generated insights and recommendations. Some features (such as advanced insights and micronutrient tracking) are available only to Joul Pro subscribers.

Some features are offered on a paid subscription basis (“Joul Pro”).

- **Billing**: If you purchase a subscription, you will be charged through Apple’s App Store using the payment method associated with your Apple ID.
- **Auto‑renewal**: Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
- **Managing and cancelling**: You can manage and cancel your subscription in your Apple ID account settings. Deleting the app does **not** cancel your subscription.
- **Trials**: If we offer a free trial, you will be charged when the trial period ends unless you cancel before then.

All payments, refunds, and billing issues are handled by Apple. Please refer to Apple’s terms and policies for more information.

## 5. License and Acceptable Use

We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to use Joul for personal, non‑commercial purposes, subject to these Terms.

You agree **not** to:
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to access the app’s source code.
- Use Joul for any unlawful, harmful, or fraudulent purpose.
- Interfere with or disrupt the operation of Joul or its servers.

We may suspend or terminate your access if we believe you have violated these Terms.

## 6. User Content and Data

You may submit content to Joul, including meal data, notes, and other information (“User Content”).

You retain ownership of your User Content, but grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to use, store, process, and anonymize it as necessary to operate and improve the service (for example, to generate your insights, maintain backups, and improve our models).

We handle your data in accordance with our [Privacy Policy]([https://yogeshsharma140781.github.io/joul-legal/Privacy.html]).

## 7. AI‑Generated Insights

Joul may use AI models to generate insights, tips, and recommendations based on your data.

You understand and agree that:
- AI outputs may be incomplete, inaccurate, or not applicable to your circumstances.
- You remain solely responsible for any decisions or actions you take based on these outputs.

## 8. No Medical Advice

Joul is **not** a medical device and does **not** provide medical, nutritional, or health advice.

- The app is for informational and educational purposes only.
- Joul does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.
- Always consult a qualified healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet, exercise, or health regimen.

Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of information provided by Joul.

## 9. Third‑Party Services

Joul may integrate with third‑party services (such as analytics providers, AI APIs, or payment processors). Your use of those services may be governed by additional third‑party terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third‑party services.

## 10. Intellectual Property

All rights, title, and interest in Joul, including the app, software, design, logos, and content (excluding your User Content), are owned by Joul or its licensors and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws.

You may not use our name, logo, or branding without our prior written consent.

## 11. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to Joul at any time, with or without notice, if we reasonably believe:
- You have violated these Terms, or
- We need to do so for security, legal, or operational reasons.

You may stop using Joul at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including fees owed, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution) will continue to apply.

## 12. Disclaimer of Warranties

Joul is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement. We do not warrant that Joul will be uninterrupted, error‑free, secure, or accurate.

## 13. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, in no event will Joul, its owners, employees, or partners be liable for:

- Any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
- Any loss of data, profits, revenues, or business opportunities,

arising out of or related to your use of Joul, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to Joul will not exceed the amount you paid for the service in the three (3) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or, if you have not paid, one hundred U.S. dollars (USD $100).

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations; in such cases, these limitations shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 14. Changes to the Service and Terms

We may update Joul and these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes to the Terms, we will notify you by updating the “Last updated” date and, when appropriate, via in‑app notice.

Your continued use of Joul after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree, you must stop using Joul.

## 15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Netherlands, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

Any disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or Joul will be resolved exclusively in the courts located in the Netherlands, unless applicable law requires otherwise.
