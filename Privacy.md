We collect the following categories of information:

### 1.1 Information you provide to us

- **Account information (if applicable)**: such as your name, email address, and any profile information you choose to provide.
- **Meal and nutrition data**: foods you log, meal times, quantities, and any tags or notes you add.
- **Profile and preference data**: such as age range, gender, goals, or dietary preferences if you choose to provide them, so we can personalize insights.
- **Support communications**: messages you send to our support channels and any additional information you provide when you contact us.

### 1.2 Information collected automatically

We may use third‑party analytics tools (such as those provided by Apple or other providers) to help us collect and analyze this information.

- We do **not** receive or store your full payment card details.

### 1.4 Information from third‑party services

If you choose to connect Joul with third‑party services in the future (for example, health data sources), we will explain what data is requested and how it’s used at the time of connection.
